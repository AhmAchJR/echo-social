/*he multer middleware on the server processes the file upload, 
saving it and making its details available to your route handler.

file Information: After multer processes the file, 
information about the uploaded file is available in req.file. 
You can use this information to store details about the file in your database or perform other operations.

Multer Middleware: The upload.single('profileImage') middleware 
processes the incoming request.
It extracts the file from the form data and saves it to the specified location (e.g., uploads/ directory).

multer processes the uploaded file and saves it to the server.
Your route handler (app.post('/register')) 
receives the request with the file details available in req.file.

*/

/*

You cannot use upload.array() and upload.fields() together in the same middleware configuration 
because each method is designed to handle file uploads in different ways and 
they are mutually exclusive.

upload.array()
Purpose: Handles multiple files from a single form field.
Usage: This method is used when you expect multiple files 
to be uploaded under one specific field name.

upload.fields()
Purpose: Handles multiple files from multiple form fields.
Usage: This method is used when you have multiple fields, 
each potentially containing multiple files.
